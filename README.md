# LLM IPA and Pronunciation Keys
IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) and pronunciation keys as generated by an LLM (Google Gemini)
on a large scale (174 locales/languages and dialects), output by BCP-47 code. 

Data has not been verified by humans, and certainly contains errors. 
Intended for experimentation purposes, for instance for creating 
text-to-text IPA or language-specific pronunciation keys.

The fields are as follows:

1. The BCP-47 code
2. The word (or words)
3. The IPA for the word
4. The language-specific pronunciation key (Gemini is asked for the most 
   common transcription, though there usually are multiple kinds of systems, and which system to use was not specified)
